## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-02

### Added

- **Design and project foundation**: feature breakdown, architecture, engine
  evaluation, technology choices, menu-bar UI mockups, consolidated design
  decisions, Apache 2.0 licensing, contribution and security guidance.
- **Daemon** (Python 3.12, asyncio): SQLite-backed store, utterance state
  machine with named transitions, parallel synthesis pool, strictly serial
  in-order playback controller that solely owns the audio device, and
  NDJSON-over-Unix-socket IPC (mode 0600) with typed errors and event
  subscription. Restart recovery re-queues interrupted synthesis and never
  resumes speaking on its own.
- **Sensitivity routing**: every utterance carries `public` / `internal` /
  `confidential` (fail-closed default `confidential`); non-public text can
  never route to a non-local engine.
- **CLI** (`ai-tts`): say/wait/list/history/pause/resume/skip/rewind/cancel/
  clear/status/voices/settings/daemon. Exit 0 means accepted onto the queue;
  `say --wait` and `wait` exit 0 only for Played.
- **Kokoro-82M engine adapter** via the reference `kokoro` package, one warm
  pipeline per language.
- **Snapshot protocol**: one daemon request returns status, both queues, the
  merged playback plan, history, voices and settings; status carries live
  playback position and history items carry completion time.
- **Menu-bar app** (Swift/SwiftUI, `clients/menubar`): custom animated template
  tray icons; event-driven refresh with reconnect; Now Playing progress and
  clocks; true-plan Up Next with hover actions; synthesis Queue; day-grouped,
  expandable History; voice previews; Settings; and global transport controls.
- **Infrastructure**: pytest suite written before the implementation, ruff
  `--select ALL` and `mypy --strict` clean, git hooks in `scripts/hooks/`,
  GitHub Actions CI (Python + Swift), launchd agent plist.

### Changed

- Editorial pass over all documentation: restructured overused em-dash
  connectors into plain sentences and removed small repetitions. No claims,
  decisions, or open questions changed.

### Fixed

- The synthesis Queue no longer appears empty while already-generated clips
  remain scheduled. `Ready` results stay visible in a dedicated section until
  playback begins.
